However, both fundamentally failed to address the requirements of a competitive intelligence query, missing key sections like 'Recent Moves' and 'Direct Threats', and offering no actionable competitive strategy recommendations. Their reliance on FY2024 data also made them severely outdated for the specified 'past 6 weeks' recency requirement. Response A is marginally superior due to a more organized and comprehensive presentation of financial ratios.",
